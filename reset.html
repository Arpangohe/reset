    VS Code comes with several built-in light themes,
    but you can also install additional light themes from the VS Code marketplace. 
    To install a new light theme, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X), 
    search for the theme you want to install, and click the "Install" button. 
    Once the theme is installed, you can select it from the list of available themes as described above.
